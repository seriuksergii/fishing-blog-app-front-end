# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Carp fishing is not just a hobby for me; it’s a passion that combines the thrill of competition with the tranquility of nature. I adore carp fishing because it feels like a challenging game between the carp and myself. It's a pursuit that resembles a hunt, where strategy and skill are essential for success.

In this unique game, the rules are simple: who will outsmart whom? The carp are intelligent and cunning, making them a worthy opponent. Every time I cast my line, I enter a mental battle, trying to anticipate their moves and lure them in. The excitement of the chase is exhilarating, and every catch feels like a well-deserved victory.

Moreover, carp fishing offers a beautiful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It allows me to connect with nature, breathing in the fresh air and enjoying the serene surroundings. There’s something incredibly calming about sitting by the water, surrounded by the sounds of wildlife, as I wait for a bite.

In conclusion, carp fishing is more than just a sport; it’s a way to unwind and reconnect with nature. The thrill of the competition and the peaceful environment make it an experience that I cherish deeply. Whether I catch a fish or not, each trip to the water leaves me feeling fulfilled and rejuvenated.
